		<p> It was many and many a year ago,<br>
        In a kingdom by the sea,<br>
    	That a maiden there lived whom you may know<br>
        By the name of Annabel Lee;<br>
    	And this maiden she lived with no other thought<br>
        Than to love and be loved by me.</p>

    	<p>I was a child and she was a child,<br>
        In this kingdom by the sea;<br>
    	But we loved with a love that was more than love-<br>
        I and my Annabel Lee;<br>
    	With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven<br>
        Coveted her and me.</p>

    	<p>And this was the reason that, long ago,<br>
        In this kingdom by the sea,<br>
    	A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling<br>
        My beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
    	So that her highborn kinsman came<br>
        And bore her away from me,<br>
    	To shut her up in a sepulchre<br>
        In this kingdom by the sea.</p>

    	<p>The angels, not half so happy in heaven,<br>
        Went envying her and me-<br>
    	Yes!- that was the reason (as all men know,<br>
        In this kingdom by the sea)<br>
    	That the wind came out of the cloud by night,<br>
        Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.</p>

    	<p>But our love it was stronger by far than the love<br>
        Of many far wiser than we-<br>
    	And neither the angels in heaven above,<br>
        Nor the demons down under the sea,<br>
    	Can ever dissever my soul from the soul<br>
        Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.</p>

    	<p>For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams<br>
        Of the beautiful Annabel Lee<br>
      	And the stars never rise but I feel the bright eyes<br>
        Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;<br>
    	And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side<br>
    	Of my darling- my darling- my life and my bride,<br>
        In the sepulchre there by the sea,<br>
        In her tomb by the sounding sea.</p>
